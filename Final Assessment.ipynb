    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems\n",

    "machine learning allows the user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data.\n",

    "The key principle of supervised learning methods is that we build them using data that contains values for all the inputs and the output. This allows the model to identify how the input values relate to output values when creating its function. \n",
    "In supervised learning, algorithms are divided into two problems: in Classification or regression.\n",
    "Classification\n",
    "In the classification, the algorithm has the Aim to assign the input data to specific categories. To do this, it recognises certain features and patterns within the data set and tries to find similarities and differencesto make a corresponding classification. Categories can be, for example, \"cat\" and \"dog\" or \"green\" and \"orange\".\n",
    "Examples of classification algorithms: Decision trees, Random Forest, Linear classifiers, Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "Regression. In regression, the algorithm tries to find the Identify relationships between dependent and independent variables and refers to continuous data. Regression algorithms are used Primarily used for forecastssuch as election and purchase forecasts or the prediction of the price development of a property.\n",

    "Overfitting refers to a model that models the training data too well.\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.\n",
    "For example, decision trees are a nonparametric machine learning algorithm that is very flexible and is subject to overfitting training data. This problem can be addressed by pruning a tree after it has learned in order to remove some of the detail it has picked up.\n",
    "Underfitting refers to a model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data.\n",

    "Train Set: \n",
    "The train set would contain the data which will be fed into the model. In simple terms, our model would learn from this data. For instance, a Regression model would use the examples in this data to find gradients in order to reduce the cost function. Then these gradients will be used to reduce the cost and predict data effectively.\n",
    "Dev Set: \n",
    "The development set is used to validate the trained model. This is the most important setting as it will form the basis of our model evaluation. If the difference between error on the training set and error on the dev set is huge, it means the model as high variance and hence, a case of over-fitting.\n",
    "Test Set: \n",
    "The test set contains the data on which we test the trained and validated model. It tells us how efficient our overall model is and how likely is it going to predict something which does not make sense. There are a plethora of evaluation metrics (like precision, recall, accuracy, etc.) which can be used to measure the performance of our model.\n",
